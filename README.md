# Cloud-Server

## Cloud server with AWS

### The process

- Despite making an account well in advance, make sure there is a saved payment option to create free things or you will have to wait 24 hrs to get your profile up and running. Yikes.
- Tried uploading different zip files created with NodeJS and it did not work. Severe issues
- Third times a charm, fingers crossed
